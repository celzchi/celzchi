<p1>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) will nurture students’ ability to gauge from simple to complex problems of the society and how these learners are responsive and active in designing its solutions through researches as to apply and integrate scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical ideas. STEM strands will also prepare learners for college degrees that focus on the perplexity of the intrinsic world making them the future scientists, experts in technological advancement, engineers, mathematicians and so on.</p1>
<p2>STEM subjects enhance cognitive abilities, such as thinking, reading, and learning, by challenging students to engage in analytical thinking, coding, and engineering principles from an early age, promoting problem-solving proficiency.</p2>
